# Dotknet
`/dɒtkə-ˈnɛt/` or `/dɒtkeɪ-ˈnɛt/`?

Dotknet is a tool for building simple dotnet container images without docker or dockerfiles.

It is inspired by [ko](https://github.com/google/ko), [jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib), & [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/).

It is ideal for environments where installing docker or maintaining dockerfiles is unreasonable, unnecessary, or undesired.

# Current Status
Unstable, not working at all, under active development.

# dotknet
`/dɒtkeɪ-ˈnɛt/`

## ⚠️ Under Active Development

Dotknet is a tool for building simple dotnet docker images (locally or in a CI/CD pipeline) without a docker daemon or dockerfiles. Reference this [article](https://github.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/tree/main/articles/moving-and-building-images) for reasons why building images without the docker daemon might be desirable.

Dotknet can be compared to (and is inspired by) [ko](https://github.com/google/ko) & [jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib).

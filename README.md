`/dɒtkə-ˈnɛt/` or `/dɒtkeɪ-ˈnɛt/`?

Dotknet is a tool for building simple dotnet container images without docker or dockerfiles. 

It is inspired and influenced by [crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/doc/crane_append.md), [ko](https://github.com/google/ko), [jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib), [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/), and this [article](https://github.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/tree/main/articles/moving-and-building-images) from [Jason Hall](https://twitter.com/imjasonh).

It is ideal for environments where installing docker or maintaining dockerfiles is unnecessary, undesired, or untenable.
